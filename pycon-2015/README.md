# PyCon 2015 Wrap Up

The AppNeta team has just returned from an amazing weekend at [PyCon 2015][1].
PyCon was held in Montreal, where the team members brushed up on their French
while basking in the many fabulous talks given by this years speakers. Thus,
we've compiled a "favorites" list from some of our team members:

The AppNeta team has just returned from a fantastically fun, edifying, and exhausting weekend at [PyCon 2015][1]. PyCon was held in Montreal this year, giving team members the opportunity to brush up on their French, binge on poutine, and absorb the many fabulous talks given by this year's speakers (including our very own development manager, Geoff Gerriets!). 

We've compiled a list of some of our favorite talks and hope you enjoy them as much as we did!

## Katie Schick

Diversity in engineering is a common topic of debate, discussion, and lengthy blog posts--and rightly so. However, it's less common to encounter a narrative that not only clearly defines some of the problems but also offers actionable solutions to them. Kate Heddleston's well-researched and powerful talk on "How our engineering environments are killing diversity" accomplished just that. The most compelling idea to me was that of accruing "team debt" (alongside your technical debt) and how a "lack of on-boarding can hurt people who aren't like the existing team." I won't spoil the rest for you, but I highly encourage checking out both Kate's [talk][2] and [blog][3]. 

At AppNeta, we spend a lot of time thinking about how best to convey the meaning of our mountains of data, so I was really excited about [Sarah Bird's talk][4] on "Interactive data for the web - Bokeh for web developers." It was amazing to see the dynamic, interactive data visualizations we could create using only Python! Sarah did a great job of walking us through the process of creating a pretty complex Bokeh visualization, while also explaining what was going on under the hood.

[Melanie Warrick's talk][5] on "Neural Nets for Newbies" took an incredibly complex topic and broke it down in a way that truly was for "newbies." As a person entirely unfamiliar with neural nets prior to the talk, I really appreciated that her goal was not for us to understand everything she said, but rather to give us a framework on which to build our continued learning. I walked away feeling as though I had a grasp on what neural nets were and how they worked and am excited to learn more.
