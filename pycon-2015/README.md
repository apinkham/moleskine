The AppNeta team has just returned from a fantastically fun, edifying, and exhausting weekend at [PyCon 2015][1]. PyCon was held in Montreal this year, giving team members the opportunity to brush up on their French, binge on poutine, and absorb the many fabulous talks given by this year's speakers (including our very own development manager, Geoff Gerriets!). 

We've compiled a list of some of our favorite talks and hope you enjoy them as much as we did!
