# PyCon 2015 Wrap Up

The AppNeta team has just returned from an amazing weekend at [PyCon 2015][1].
PyCon was held in Montreal, where the team members brushed up on their French
while basking in the many fabulous talks given by this years speakers. Thus,
we've compiled a "favorites" list from some of our team members:

## Katie Schick

## Geoff Gerrietts

* **[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSbKjRRbjZs](The Ethical Consequences of
  Our Collective Activities)** leads my list off. Our profession has more than
  a passing resemblance to the practice of law, and it should incur similar
  responsibilities and offer similar privilege. Glyph offers a compelling
  thesis with grace, nuance, and a little bit of provocation.

* In **[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAFGQurdJ3U](Distributed Systems
  101)**, lvh provides a solid grounding in a complicated topic. As web
  developers, we wrestle with distributed systems problems quite frequently --
  "What happens when two web nodes try to write to the same row of the same
  table?" Grounding the discussion of those challenges in distributed systems
  theory makes resolutions clearer and more effective.

* **[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoWG0lavg9U]("Words, Words, Words")**
  harkens back to my origins as a student of English, looking to use computers
  to enhance our literary experience. Adam delivers on this premise, producing
  some real insights in the reading of Othello and the sonnets even within the 
  short bounds of this talk.

## Dan Riti

TBD

## Conclusion
