# Meet python-traceview: A library for accessing the TraceView API

Not to long ago, we introduced the [TraceView Data API][1], which exposes high
level metrics and performance data related to your TraceView account via a
[RESTful][9] API. For the unfamiliar, this means you access to
[server latency timeseries][5], [error rates][6], and even
[browsers used by end users][7].

In an effort to make accessing the Data API even easier, I have a created
[python-traceview][2], a Python library for easy access to the TraceView Data
API!

## Installation

To install python-traceview, simply:

```bash
$ pip install python-traceview
```

If you don't have Python installed, I recommend this [guide][10] for
installation instructions and best practices.

## Quick Start

Begin by importing the ``traceview`` module:

```python
>>> import traceview
```

Now, let's initialize a `TraceView` object using your TraceView access (API)
key. You can find this key on the **Organization Overview** page in TraceView:

```python
>>> tv = traceview.TraceView('API KEY HERE')
```

Now, we have a `TraceView` object called ``tv``. We can get all the information
we need from this object.

For example, let's get all available applications setup within your TraceView
account:

```python
>>> tv.apps()
[u'Default', u'pyramid_web_app']
```

Nice, right? We can also get a server side latency summary for the ``Default``
application:

```python
>>> tv.server.latency_summary(app='Default', time_window='hour')
{u'count': 2746.0, u'average': 213911.87181354698, u'latest': 35209.87654320987}
```

TraceView has traced 2746 requests in the last hour, with an average latency of
213ms. Thatâ€™s all well and good, but let's show off the power of working with
your data in Python.

Let's examine what application layers are available in the `Default`
application:

```python
>>> tv.layers('Default')
[u'PHP', u'cURL', u'file_get_contents', u'lighttpd', u'php_mysql', u'php_mysqli']
```

Using the powerful [matplotlib][11] library, let's write a short script for
creating a graph of the `PHP` layer's latency over the past week:

```python
from datetime import datetime

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import traceview

tv = traceview.TraceView('API KEY HERE')
results = tv.server.latency_series(app='Default', layer='PHP', time_window='week')

# convert timestamps to datetime objects
dates = [datetime.utcfromtimestamp(i[0]) for i in results['items']]

# convert average latency to milliseconds (divide by 1000)
php_average_latency = []
for item in results['items']:
    average_latency = item[2]
    if average_latency:
        php_average_latency.append(average_latency / 1000)
    else:
        php_average_latency.append(0)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5), dpi=80)
plt.plot(dates, php_average_latency)
plt.ylabel('Average Latency (milliseconds)')
plt.title('PHP Average Latency - by Week')
plt.savefig('latency.png')
```

![php average latency by week][11]

## Conclusion

Supports Python 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
