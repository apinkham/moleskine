# Burndown Before You Burn Out

![Logo](https://raw.github.com/danriti/burndown-intro/master/images/logo.png)

A few months ago we [annouced][1] [Burndown][2], an open source web application for
tracking the progress of Github milestones. For those of you that missed out:

> Harnessing the power of the mighty [Github API][3], Burndown provides a dead
simple way to generate a [burndown chart][4] for any Github milestone. This is
helpful for tracking both progress and performance, as well as identifying what
work remains.

Well we're happy to let you know that we've been hard at work adding some new
features and bug fixes to Burndown!

## 30 Day Summary

You can now view a "30 Day Summary", which provides a high level overview of
your repository. This chart tracks the number of issues that have been 
opened and closed over the past 30 days, regardless of milestone. This is 
useful in determining if your team is making positive traction 
(i.e. `closed issues > opened issues`), especially when it seems like the 
number of issues in your repository never drops.

## Filter Milestone Issues by Label

Milestone issue lists are now filterable by **label**. This is a helpful 
feature if you use labels on Github to tag issues for team specific 
actions (i.e. QA, Test, etc).

## Milestone Enhancements

Finally, we added some nice UI enhancements to our milestone view:

- List
- of
- Enhancements

Got an idea for a new feature? Do you use Burndown to help keep your team on
track? We'd be happy to hear your ideas or how you use Burndown, so feel free 
to drop us a comment or [create an issue][5]!
