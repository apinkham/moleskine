# Pageguide x Bower

![Bower logo][5]

What happens when you take [Pageguide][3], our open source interactive visual
guide to elements on web pages and combine it with [Bower][2], a package manager
for the web?

```
$ bower install pageguide
```

Oh yeah!

For the unfamiliar, [Bower][2] is a package manager for client-side libraries,
assets, and frameworks. Bower isn't just for JavaScript libraries, but you can
also find a large offering of other [components][11] (stylesheets, images,
fonts, etc) neatly packaged in its repository. Check out the [tutorial][10] for
installing and using Bower.

When getting started with Pageguide, you now have the following options:

- Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install pageguide`
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tracelytics/pageguide.git`
- Download the latest [release][9]

Insert some witty closing statement?
