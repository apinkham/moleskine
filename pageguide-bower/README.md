# Pageguide x Bower

![Bower logo][5]

What happens when you take Pageguide, our open source interactive visual guide
to elements on web pages and combine it with Bower, a package manager for the
web?

```
$ bower install pageguide
```

For the unfamiliar, [Bower][2] is a package manager for the web. It provides
an easy way to manage front-end packages (think [jQuery][6], [d3][7],
[bootstrap][8], etc) for any project.

So you now have all the following options when getting started with Pageguide:

- Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install pageguide`
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tracelytics/pageguide.git`
- Download the latest [release](https://github.com/tracelytics/pageguide/releases)
