# Introducing the ServiceWorker

At Velocity NY this past year, I was introduced by [Alex Russell][2] to
[Service Workers][1]. For the uninitiated, Service Workers are a bleeding edge
browser feature that provide event-driven scripts that run independently of web
pages. A Service Worker script runs in the background on it's own thread,
and provides the ability to respond to events even when the user is offline.
This opens the door for developers to be able to gracefully handle the offline
experience for users, especially on mobile where the network can be unreliable.
