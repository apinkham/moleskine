# Introducing the ServiceWorker

At Velocity NY this past year, I was introduced by [Alex Russell][2] to
[Service Workers][1]. For the uninitiated, Service Workers is a new browser
feature that provide event-driven scripts that run independently of web pages.

Service Workers are a web worker that
enables applications to take advantage of persistent background processing,
including hooks to enable bootstrapping of web applications while offline.
