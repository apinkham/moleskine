## Notes

- Create tests to confirm mock assumptions and protect mismatching mocks and implementation.
- Disabling mocks will enable you to see mock vs implementation diffs
- Link to urlmock/response argument types (advanced usage)
- Handling GET (read fixtures)
- Handling POST (create fixtures)
- Handling exceptions (resource does not exist)
- Encapsulating mocks behind configuration variable
