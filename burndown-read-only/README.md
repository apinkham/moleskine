# Burndown Goes Read Only

After Burndown got some [unexpected attention][3] last week, we got
[feedback][2] from several netizens who wanted to use [Burndown][4] but were
uncomfortable with the default permissions (access to both private & public
repositories) because they use a single Github profile for both personal and
business work.

Well Internet, we're listening! Burndown now has the ability to let users
authenticate against Github and limit access to only public repositories
(read-only)!

So head on over to http://burndown.io and start burning down before you burn
out! As always, let us [know][5] if you have any feedback or ideas for improving
Burndown.
