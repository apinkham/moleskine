Setting up your application to use the TraceView add-on is easy. Just check out
the [instructions][1] on the Heroku Dev Center to get started. It's important to
note that only **Ruby** applications are supported by the TraceView add-on at
this time.

The TraceView Beta is free to the public. Tiered plans will be announced at the
end of the Beta and the free tier will still be available if you're on a tight
budget.
